# Driver-detection
The project bases on keras to detect the driver's actions which are correct or dangerous, thank you for your reading
The project will use the VGG , ResNet and MobileNet_v1 to detect the driver datasets.


# 1.my_models directory
      In the directory, you can get the VGG models ,ResNet models, and MobileNet_v1 based on the keras or tensorflow.
