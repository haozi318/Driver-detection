# Driver-detection
The project bases on keras to detect the driver's actions which are correct or dangerous, thank you for your reading
The project will use the VGG , ResNet and MobileNet_v1 to detect the driver datasets.
The project running the pycharm, so for the .sh file you should use the Git (recommend).

# 1.my_models directory
      In the directory, you can get the VGG models ,ResNet models, and MobileNet_v1 based on the keras or tensorflow.
      
# 2.picture_data directory
      This is a result. when you run the code ,you can get the result in here.
      
# 3.state-farm-distracted-driver-detection directory
      There are your datasets dowmloading form https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data.
    
# 4.  0_train.sh 
      This is a .sh file ,you should run it for training the models
      
# 5.  1_test.sh
      This is a .sh file too, you can run it for testing the models.
      
# 6. main.py
      The file is the important, you can change something you want.
     
     
     
# My_result
      This is my first create project in the github, If you can see here ,thank you!!. The project is my undergraduate graduation thesis's code, and I want to remenber the beautiful time.
